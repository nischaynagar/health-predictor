        <h4>Cancer</h4>
        <p>
          Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow
          uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer can start
          almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of
          cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process
          called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When
          cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their
          place.Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or
          damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells may
          form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not
          cancerous (benign).
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel
          to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called
          metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors.
          Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as
          leukemias, generally do not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When
          removed, benign tumors usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous
          tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large,
          however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life threatening, such
          as benign tumors in the brain.

        <h4>Diabetes</h4>
        <p>
          Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease
          that causes high blood sugar. The hormone insulin moves sugar from the
          blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With diabetes,
          your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use
          the insulin it does make.
        </p>
        <p>
          Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes,
          kidneys, and other organs.
        </p>
        <p>There are a few different types of diabetes:</p>
        <p>
          Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. The immune system attacks
          and destroys cells in the pancreas, where insulin is made. It’s
          unclear what causes this attack. About 10 percent of people with
          diabetes have this type
        </p>
        <p>
          Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin,
          and sugar builds up in your blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prediabetes occurs when your blood sugar is higher than normal, but
          it’s not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetesPrediabetes
          occurs when your blood sugar is higher than normal, but it’s not high
          enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
        </p>
        <p>
          Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar during pregnancy.
          Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the placenta cause this type of
          diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rare condition called diabetes insipidus is not related to diabetes
          mellitus, although it has a similar name. It’s a different condition
          in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each type of diabetes has unique symptoms, causes, and treatments.

        <h4>kidney</h4>
        <p>
          You have two kidneys, each about the size of your fist. They are near
          the middle of your back, just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney
          there are about a million tiny structures called nephrons. They filter
          your blood. They remove wastes and extra water, which become urine.
          The urine flows through tubes called ureters. It goes to your bladder,
          which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave
          kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems,
          injuries, or medicines. You have a higher risk of kidney disease if
          you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or a close family member with
          kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly
          over several years. Other kidney problems include
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cancer</li>
          <li>Cysts</li>
          <li>Stones</li>
          <li>Infections</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your doctor can do blood and urine tests to check if you have kidney
          disease. If your kidneys fail, you will need dialysis or a kidney
          transplant.

        <h4>Liver</h4>
        <p>
          The liver is an organ about the size of a football. It sits just under
          your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen. The liver is
          essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic
          substances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liver disease can be inherited (genetic). Liver problems can also be
          caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such as viruses,
          alcohol use and obesity
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, conditions that damage the liver can lead to scarring
          (cirrhosis), which can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening
          condition. But early treatment may give the liver time to heal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liver disease doesn't always cause noticeable signs and symptoms. If
          signs and symptoms of liver disease do occur, they may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice</li>
          <li>Abdominal pain and swelling</li>
          <li>Swelling in the legs and ankles</li>
          <li>Itchy skin</li>
          <li>Dark urine color</li>
          <li>Pale stool color</li>
          <li>Chronic fatigue</li>
          <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
          <li>Loss of appetite</li>
          <li>Tendency to bruise easily</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your doctor can do blood and urine tests to check if you have kidney
          disease. If your kidneys fail, you will need dialysis or a kidney
          transplant.

        <h4>Heart</h4>
        <p>
          Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart.
          Heart diseases include:
        </p>
        <p>Blood vessel disease, such as coronary artery disease</p>
        <p>Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias)</p>
        <p>Heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects)</p>
        <p>Heart valve disease</p>
        <p>Disease of the heart muscle</p>
        <p>Heart infection</p>
        <p>
          Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy
          lifestyle choices.
        </p>
        <h6>Symptoms</h6>
        <p>
          Heart disease symptoms depend on what type of heart disease you have.
        </p>
        <h6>Symptoms of heart disease in your blood vessels</h6>
        <p>
          A buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries, or atherosclerosis
          (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis) can damage your blood vessels and heart.
          Plaque buildup causes narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead
          to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women.
          For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more
          likely to have other signs and symptoms along with chest discomfort,
          such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.
        </p>
        <h6>Signs and symptoms can include:</h6>
        <p>
          Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort
          (angina) Shortness of breath Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in
          your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are
          narrowed Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back You
          might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a
          heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch
          for cardiovascular symptoms and discuss concerns with your doctor.
          Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular
          evaluations.
